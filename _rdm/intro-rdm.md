# Overview

This workshop will introduce you to Research Data Management (RDM), and its relationship to research culture, and best practices in conducting research.

We will then move into discussing emerging requirements for RDM in the funding and publishing landscape.

We all also dive into RDM considerations for creating a data management plan before creating a data management plan with [DMP Assistant](https://dmp-pgd.ca/){:target="_blank"}.

# What is RDM?
**Research data management** is a general term for how you plan for and carry out the handling of your data for your research project from the planning stages through data gathering/generation, active analysis, and into data deposit or long-term storage and preservation as a project is completed. 

Research Data Management means planning for and carrying out processes related to: 

* data collection and documentation of that data, 
* storing and backing up data,
* thinking about long term preservation of data 
* sharing and reuse of data, 
* any ethical implications about how data needs to be handled, preserved, or shared, 
* and any other responsibilities around dealing with the data. 

Now, a key thing to remember with research data management is that it occurs throughout the research process: 
* It should be thought about, and an initial plan should be drafted, as the project is conceived of (e.g., as funding applications and research proposals are put together).
* Then, during **data collection**, that plan can guide how you collect and document data while data is actively in use. 
* Where and how you **store your data** is important for you and your own project (e.g., having back-ups to mitigate data loss), but also for you and your work to be in compliance with any relevant ethical and legal requirements (e.g., if you are working with human participant data with identifiers that must be kept confidential or removed from the data, or if you are working with proprietary data. If you are applying for an ethics application at AU, section 5 of the ethics application is around how you are storing, retaining, and disposing your data.
* After the project is completed, the data needs to be stored and preserved. If you want to (or are required to) share your data, you should plan for this from the start because it is easier to share and reuse well documented and well formatted data
* The earlier you start this plan the easier it is to document your data or share your data once you get approval from ethics and consent from participants earlier in the project than to have to revisit this again.

# RDM as Part of Research Culture
Good research data management is a part of doing rigorous research and contributes to a vibrant research culture. Essentially if you are doing a project, you will doing some research data management anyways. Research data management supports the following:
* Open scholarship movements
* Making publicly funded research publicly accessible
* Responsible use of funds 
* Recognizing investment and effort in data collection and curation
* Documenting rigour in research practice

It can support **open scholarship** by documenting processes and making them more transparent so that data can be shared and reused. This is also in keeping with open access and open research movements motivated by the desire to make **publicly funded research publicly accessible**. Preserving data and making it accessible for reuse when possible is also a way of **recognizing the funds and efforts** involved in data collection/generation. (if you set your terms and conditions to allow other researchers to use your data as secondary data, then the value of your research grow exponentially, because it allows other researchers to reuse in their projects, so the initial value of your data goes beyond your initial research).

Next, when we think about best practices in RDM, there are some principles to consider. 

# FAIR Principles
The Go FAIR initiative promotes the FAIR principles, which underly research data management practices.

When you are planning and carrying out your data management you will want to consider how you can make your data FAIR.

## Findable
The first step in (re)using data is to find them. Data should be easy to find for both humans and computers. They should be well described (have sufficient metadata) and persistent identifiers.

## Accessible
Once the user finds the required data, she/he/they needs to know how the data can be accessed, possibly including authentication and authorisation. Depositing data in a trusted repository makes data more accessible to other researchers.

## Interoperable
The data usually need to be integrated with other data. In addition, the data need to interoperate with applications or workflows for analysis, storage, and processing.

## Reusable
The ultimate goal of FAIR is to optimise the reuse of data. To achieve this goal, metadata and data should be well-described so that they can be replicated and/or combined in different settings. Usage permissions and provenance should be clear.

The FAIR principles can be thought of **AS A CONTINUUM as data can be more or less FAIR**.

**Not all data can be 100% open and accessible and freely online**. That’s not necessarily appropriate in all contexts. But there may be a statement about the data used in a particular project, who to contact to gain access to that data and under what conditions the data can or cannot be made available. Sometimes the FAIR principles also tend to focus a little bit more on machine actionability of data. So that data is described in a way that people can access it and work with it in computing environments and that may be more or less relevant to your project depending on what type of data you are collecting, how you’re processing it and what makes sense in your own research area. 

## FAIR Principles Knowledge Check
Which of the FAIR principles apply to the following (answers in the [Slides](/assets/pdf/2025-10-15_FGSseries_IntroToRDM_Slides.pdf){:target="_blank"}):
1. My dataset is stored in a repository and can be retrieved using a DOI
2. I’ve assigned a license to my dataset so others know how the dataset can be used.
3. My dataset is openly available to download from trusted repository.
4. My dataset is in CSV format so multiple programs can read it.

# CARE and OCAP Principles
The CARE and OCAP principles are important and particularly if you are working for indigenous communities or data about indigenous peoples and they support the concept of indigenous data sovereignty. So the CARE principles include were drafted in by the Global Indigenous Data Alliance that can be used to guide your planning, but you still always want to be working with your particular community partners or at doing things appropriate to context. OCAP is more Canada specific and specific to first nations. It was put forward by the First Nations Information Governance Center and they have their own training they offer on applying the principles.

The **Care Principles for Indigenous Data Governance** (from the Global Indigenous Data Alliance) include:

* **Collective Benefit**: Data ecosystems shall be designed and function in ways that enable Indigenous Peoples to derive benefit from the data

* **Authority to Control**: Indigenous Peoples’ rights and interests in Indigenous data must be recognised and their authority to control such data be empowered. Indigenous data governance enables Indigenous Peoples and governing bodies to determine how Indigenous Peoples, as well as Indigenous lands, territories, resources, knowledges and geographical indicators, are represented and identified within data.

* **Responsibility**:Those working with Indigenous data have a responsibility to share how those data are used to support Indigenous Peoples’ self-determination and collective benefit. Accountability requires meaningful and openly available evidence of these efforts and the benefits accruing to Indigenous Peoples.

* **Ethics**: Indigenous Peoples’ rights and wellbeing should be the primary concern at all stages of the data life cycle and across the data ecosystem.

The **Principles of OCAP** are Canadian and specific to First Nations contexts. They include:

1. **Ownership** refers to the relationship of First Nations to their cultural knowledge, data, and information. This principle states that a community or group owns information collectively in the same way that an individual owns his or her personal information.

2. **Control** affirms that First Nations, their communities, and representative bodies are within their rights in seeking to control over all aspects of research and information management processes that impact them. First Nations control of research can include all stages of a particular research project from start to finish. The principle extends to the control of resources and review processes, the planning process, management of the information and so on.

3. **Access** refers to the fact that First Nations must have access to information and data about themselves and their communities regardless of where it is held. The principle of access also refers to the right of First Nations’ communities and organizations to manage and make decisions regarding access to their collective information. This may be achieved, in practice, through standardized, formal protocols.

4. **Possession** While ownership identifies the relationship between a people and their information in principle, possession or stewardship is more concrete: it refers to the physical control of data. Possession is the mechanism by which ownership can be asserted and protected.

# Benefits and Advantages of RDM
Some reasons that research data management is important and why it's gaining prominence are: 
1. That it can **support efficiency and organization** by standardizing ways data are collected and dealt with. 
* It can be useful to document your practices for your own and for any team members’ reference, which can make personnel transitions and training easier on particular projects. It can also help you keep track of files and what you are doing over the course of a long-term project. (e.g. It can also just be helpful for you if you are working on your project over the course of multiple years, potentially publishing that project and then getting questions about it years later to be able to go back to your documentation and understand what you had.)
  * For example, if on a research project, there are multiple student assistants who come through, it's helpful to have documentation about just what needs to be done with the data and by whom. 
  * For graduate students, a data management plan can be an excellent communication tool between student and supervisor, and alongside of the research or project proposal, can be a foundation for documenting how data will be handled during the research project. 
2. Research Data Management also supports **increasing visibility and recognition for work with data**. 
  * You can plan for a data set to be preserved and made accessible in a repository, which also allows for that data to be cited, so other researchers can use that data and credit you.
3. RDM is also important on a larger scale by making a contribution to the movement towards open scholarship with that potential for data reuse, and it increases trust in research by supporting the replicability and transparency of studies. 
4. Using RDM best practices will help you to **comply with different stakeholders’ policies**. Funders, institutions, and publications, like journals, can each have their own policies related to data management, data retention, and data sharing. You will need to be aware of and plan for how you will comply with any policies relevant to you.

# Emerging RDM Requirements - Funders, Publishers, and Institutions
Institutions, publishers, funders, and associations at various levels can formally recognize the importance of good research data management and data sharing as a part of research culture through the provision of guidance and adoption of policies. This means that researchers need to be aware of  recommendations and requirements from various entities that could apply to their projects. These requirements may be from their home institutions and research ethics boards, from the journal they wish to publish in, from their research funder(s), or other stakeholders. 

Common RDM requirements are for data deposit or data sharing and to have a data management plan submitted as a part of the funding application. Check:
* Does your funder have any general RDM policies?
* Does the specific call for funding have any RDM related requirements?
* Do you have a target venue for publication? Do they require or recommend data deposit?
* Does your institution have any policies about handling or retaining research data?

In the Canadian context, the Tri-agency RDM policy is of particular importance.

# Tri-Agency RDM Policy (2021)
The policy has requirements for institutions and for researchers.

**Requirements for Institutions**
Institutions are required to have an institutional RDM strategy in place by March of 2023. All institutions eligible to receive Tri-Agency funding and have their researchers receive funding had to put together a strategy about how they  would support researchers in doing good data management. At AU we put together, [AU Research Data Management Institutional Strategy](https://www.athabascau.ca/research/_documents/au-rdm-strategy.pdf){:taget="_blank"} in response to this policy. It lists our high level goals for the next few years in the services and supports we are offering. 

**Requirements for Researchers**
For researchers, data management plans (DMPs) and data deposit will be required. The requirement for DMPs is being piloted on a [subset of calls](https://science.gc.ca/site/science/en/interagency-research-funding/policies-and-guidelines/research-data-management/funding-opportunities-requiring-data-management-plans){:target="_blank"}. The data deposit requirement will be phased in after institutional strategies have been reviewed. However, CIHR has requirements that apply to all projects funded from 2008 onwards for certain data types.

Note that these requirements are being phased in for grant funding, not scholarship funding, at this time. Graduate students who hold research assistant positions could work on projects that are subject to these requirements as they are phased in.

And then there’s also what they’re calling a data deposit requirement that they’re going to announce how they’re going to phase in somewhere in 2025 or 2026. And what that requirement is looking at is thinking about as you’re publishing, where are you putting the data that resulted in that publication? And the requirement is that it’s being put somewhere that can be pointed to like a repository. So it’s not an open data or open sharing policy. It is a deposit policy.

### Data Management Plans
So what a data management plan is, is an actual document that explains kind of that whole life cycle of research data. So thinking about how data will be collected, documented, formatted, protected, and preserved. If you’re going to be reusing existing data, where are you getting that data from? What is it? And will any new data be created over the course of the project? It’s also going to look at whether and how data will be shared, where that data will be deposited or retained long term, and if it will be retained long term. Tri-agency is also encouraging standardized tools like DMP Assistant.

### Data Deposit
Data deposit is a requirement that all data, metadata, and code is being placed in a repository for safe storage, curation, and preservation. And that’s all data, metadata, and code leading to a publication. The Tri-Agency policy is specific to thinking about research outputs at that publication context. And the idea is that access to the data will be provided where ethical, legal, and commercial requirements allow. So if you have a research partner or have human participants who have not consented to sharing their data, you are not expected to share the data. It’s a process that has to be thought out throughout your project and then appropriate sharing can be put in place.

## Tri-Agency Statement of Principles on Data Management
A [Statement of Principles on Digital Data Management](https://www.science.gc.ca/site/science/en/interagency-research-funding/policies-and-guidelines/research-data-management/tri-agency-statement-principles-digital-data-management){:target="blank"} was adopted in 2016. This statement includes RDM expectations and responsibilities for institutions, researchers, and funders. For researchers, the responsibilities arising from expectations in the document include: using RDM best practices in their research, developing data management plans that address the entire life cycle of a research project (and beyond), following applicable policies at their institutions or adopted by their funders, acknowledging and citing datasets, and staying current of standards or expectations in their discipline(s).

## CIHR and open access
CIHR had its own open access policy in 2013 with requirements that were included in the 2015 [Tri-Agency Open Access Policy on Publications](https://science.gc.ca/site/science/en/interagency-research-funding/policies-and-guidelines/open-access/tri-agency-open-access-policy-publications-2015){:target="_blank"}. These requirements apply to any CIHR funded project from 2008 onwards, and some of these CIHR-specific requirements relate to data:

* **Datasets must be kept for a minimum of 5 years** after the end of the grant, whether the data is published or not.
* **Bioinformatics, atomic, and molecular** coordinate data must be deposited in the appropriate public database immediately upon publication of results (see the [policy annex](https://science.gc.ca/site/science/en/interagency-research-funding/policies-and-guidelines/open-access/annex){:target="_blank"} for examples of appropriate repositories).

## SSHRC data archiving
Prior to the Tri-Agency RDM policy, SSHRC implemented a Research Data Archiving Policy in commitment to the principle that research data collected with public funds belongs in the public domain. **The policy allows for researchers to include costs of preparing data for deposit in their funding applications**.
Note that “All research data collected with the use of SSHRC funds must be preserved and made available for use by others within a reasonable period of time. SSHRC considers ‘a reasonable period’ to be within two years of the completion of the research project for which the data was collected” (SSHRC, 2016). However, the policy does recognize that there are circumstances where providing access for secondary analysis may not be possible (e.g., where ethical requirements such as confidentiality of participants needs to be respected). See the [Tri-Council Policy Statement: Ethical Conduct for Research Involving Humans (2nd ed)](https://ethics.gc.ca/eng/policy-politique_tcps2-eptc2_2022.html){:target="_blank"} for more detail about ethical requirements. Such circumstances do not preclude the need to preserve the data.

## Publisher's Requirements/Recommendations
Many publishers now have data sharing policies and/or require data availability statements, sometimes referred to as a data access statement. They may have them built into the manuscript submission process, so check the author guidelines for the specific journal you are submitting to.

* Journal of Open Archaeology data  https://openarchaeologydata.metajnl.com/
* Journal of Open Psychology Data https://openpsychologydata.metajnl.com/
* Journal of Open Health Data https://openhealthdata.metajnl.com/  
* Biodiversity Data Journal https://bdj.pensoft.net/ 
* Earth System Science Data https://www.earth-system-science-data.net/home.html  
* BMC Research Notes https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/ 
* Scientific Data https://www.nature.com/sdata/  

# Data Availability Statements
An example of data availability statements
* The data that supports the findings of the study are openly available in Athabasca Unversity's Data Repository Collection in Borealis at https://doi.org/[doi]. 

This includes the service provider where our repository sits at and gives the link with the DOI in it. 

Another example is,
* Pro-Seq data were deposited into the Gene Expression Omnibus database under accession number GSE85337 and are available at the following URL: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE85337. 

# Emerging RDM Requirements Knowledge Check
(answers in the [Slides](/assets/pdf/2025-10-15_FGSseries_IntroToRDM_Slides.pdf){:target="_blank"}):

1.  What are the three entities that provide guidance, recommendations, requirements related to data management?
2. True or False: Data should be closed as possible but as open as necessary.
3. A data management includes how data is:
A) Collected B) Documented C) Formatted D) Protected E) Preserved F) All the above
4. What can be included in a data deposit (total of 3)?
5. What is missing in this data availability statement: The datasets generated during and/or analyzed during the current study are available in Borealis.

# Data Management Plans (DMPs)
A data management plan is an actual document that describes how data will be collected, documented, formatted, protected, and preserved. It talks about how existing datasets will be used and what new data will be created over the course of a research project, whether or how data can be shared, and where that data will be deposited. 

A DMP is a living document that you can update as needed as your project evolves.

How DMPs will be evaluated in upcoming Tri-Agency competitions is yet to be fully developed, but it will be based on planning to implement best practices throughout the lifecycle. 

For graduate students a DMP is a way to plan your research project, and it is a tool you can use to communicate with your supervisor.

# Ethics, Research Partners, and Legal Consideration
As you’re working on a data management plan there are going to be ethical, community, or research partner and legal considerations that kind of overarch the entire process because they affect decisions made at all the stages of a data management plan. So thinking about things like do you have human participants or require ethics approval because a lot of the processes that you require to have in place as part of your ethics approval would also be addressed in a DMP. So you can use one to fill the other as needed or put more detail in your data management plan based on your ethics protocol as you go forward because ethics approval has to be in place before you start your research. 

If you have **community or industry partners**, do they have requirements for data access, handling or ownership. Do you keep your data when it’s done or do you have an agreement where the data is going back to a community partner or where the data belong to an industry partner and may have a NDA (non-disclosure agreement) around it. 

Think about any other **legal considerations**. Are you using an access information request or something to get additional access to data? Have you signed or agreed to specific terms in order to access or collect data? Because all of that needs to be compile with throughout your research project.

## Ethics and RDM
If you want to (or are required to) share your data, you should plan for this from the start. If you have human participants, they should be notified, and consent to, data being released. And this is typically done on the consent form when participants consent to participate in your study.

How you intend to use the data and whether or not it can be re-used and deposited is determined by the language in your information and consent documents.

Ideally, you should try to make your data as open as possible, but as closed as necessary.

The Tri-Council Policy Statement: Ethical Conduct for Research Involving Humans – TCPS 2 (2022) outlines considerations for ethical conduct of research and has chapters specifically related to
* Privacy and Confidentiality
* First Nations, Inuit and Métis Peoples of Canada
* Qualitative Research
* Clinical Trials
* Human Biological Materials
* Human Genetic Research

When thinking about that data deposit requirement coming into place, the TCPS had a section added into it about broad consent for storage of data and human biological materials for future and unspecified research. So there are some particular things that you need to think about early on in your ethics application process that will be relevant throughout your research project.
